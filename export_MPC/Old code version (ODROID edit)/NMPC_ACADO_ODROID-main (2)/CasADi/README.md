# QuadrotorNMPC

This repo is my implementation of a quadrotor NMPC using CasADi. 

The formulation and parameters refer to this paperï¼š A Comparative Study of Nonlinear MPC and Differential-Flatness-Based Control for Quadrotor Agile Flight

Specifically, the implementation refers to (10).

To run the code, make sure you install CasADi for matlab first. Then run runNMPC.m. The tracking performance will be plotted at the end.
